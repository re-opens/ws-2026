      <h2>Welcome to RE-OpenS</h2>
      <p><strong>RE-OpenS</strong> is the 1st Interactive Workshop on the Promotion of Open Science in Requirements Engineering, co-located with <strong><a href="https://2026.refsq.org/" target="_blank">REFSQ 2026</a></strong> in Poznań, Poland.</p>
    
      <p>Open science is transforming how research is conducted, shared, and evaluated. In Requirements Engineering (RE), where reproducibility and transparency are increasingly vital, adopting open science practices can significantly improve the quality and impact of scholarly work. RE-OpenS was created to empower the RE community to embrace these principles and tools in a practical, inclusive, and collaborative setting.</p>
    
      <p>The workshop supports <strong>REFSQ’s Open Science Initiative</strong>, including its <a href="https://2026.refsq.org/track/refsq-2026-open-science" target="_blank">Open Science Track</a>, <a href="https://2026.refsq.org/track/refsq-2026-open-science#Open-Science-Policy" target="_blank">Open Science Policy</a>, and <a href="https://2026.refsq.org/track/refsq-2026-open-science#Open-Science-Competition" target="_blank">Open Science Competition</a>. It provides a space for researchers to learn, experiment, and reflect on how open science can be applied meaningfully in RE research and publications.</p>
    
      <p>This half-day, paperless workshop combines theoretical insights with hands-on practice. Participants will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Explore the foundations and benefits of open science in RE</li>
        <li>Gain experience with tools like <strong><a href="https://github.com/Christof93/SciKGTeX" target="_blank">SciKGTeX</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://orkg.org/" target="_blank">ORKG</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://ask.orkg.org/" target="_blank">ORKG Ask</a></strong></li>
        <li>Create FAIR-annotated publications and ORKG comparisons</li>
        <li>Participate in a feedback session to shape future editions of RE-OpenS</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p><strong>RE-OpenS is open to all REFSQ attendees</strong>—whether you're new to open science or already contributing to its advancement. The workshop fosters skill-building, peer exchange, and community-driven innovation.</p>

        <h2>On the future of RE-OpenS</h2>
      
        <p><strong>Looking ahead</strong>, RE-OpenS aims to turn open science into a practical experience through its deliberately interactive workshop format. Future editions will respond to the needs and wishes of the community by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inviting experts for targeted practical sessions</li>
          <li>Offering a Call for Papers for:
            <ul>
              <li>Proposals for practical sessions</li>
              <li>Experience reports on the (un)successful application of open science best practices, infrastructures, services, and tools</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Sharing workshop outcomes with REFSQ’s future Open Science co-chairs to:
            <ul>
              <li>Refine REFSQ’s Open Science Policy</li>
              <li>Propose new challenges for the Open Science Competition</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
