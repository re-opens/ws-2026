      <h2>Welcome to RE-OpenS</h2>
      <p><strong>RE-OpenS</strong> is the 1st Interactive Workshop on the Promotion of Open Science in Requirements Engineering, co-located with <strong>REFSQ 2026</strong> in Poznań, Poland.</p>

      <p>Open science is essential for addressing the replication crisis and fostering transparent, accessible, and replicable research. RE-OpenS supports this mission by introducing researchers to <strong>REFSQ’s Open Science Initiative</strong>, including its Open Science Track, Policy, and Competition.</p>

      <p>This half-day, paperless workshop combines theoretical insights with hands-on practice. Participants will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn about open science principles and REFSQ’s initiative</li>
        <li>Gain practical experience using tools like <strong>SciKGTeX</strong>, <strong>ORKG</strong>, and <strong>ORKG Ask</strong></li>
        <li>Create FAIR-annotated publications and ORKG comparisons</li>
        <li>Engage in a feedback session to shape future editions of RE-OpenS</li>
      </ul>

      <p>RE-OpenS is designed for all REFSQ attendees interested in open science. Whether you're new to the topic or already contributing, this workshop offers valuable skills, networking opportunities, and a chance to influence the future of open science in RE.</p>

      <p>Estimated attendance: 10–20 participants. The workshop will be promoted via RE'25, social media, and personal networks. All organizers will be present in person, and several invited experts have expressed interest in joining.</p>
