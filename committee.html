        <p class="bio"><a href="https://www.oliver-karras.de/" target="_blank">Oliver Karras</a> is a researcher at TIB – Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology. His research focuses on the development of open science infrastructures, services, and tools to encourage and support researchers to contribute to open science across disciplines, including requirements engineering, engineering sciences, energy system research, and medicine. He has served on program and organizing committees for journals (e.g., IST, EMSE, REJ, JSS), conferences (e.g., CIKM, IRI, REFSQ, RE), and workshops (e.g., CrowdRE, D4RE, AIRE, MO2RE, EmpiRE). He was Open Science co-Chair of REFSQ 2025, where he established the REFSQ Open Science Competition. He is a member of the Open Science Board of JSS, recipient of the Best Artifact Award at RE 2024, and Artifact Track co-Chair of RE 2026, where he introduced a central Open Science Policy and Competition.</p>

    <h2>Future Organizing Committee</h2>
    <p>The organizing committee of RE-OpenS is composed of former and current Open Science co-Chairs of REFSQ, as well as individuals actively promoting open science. This structure ensures continuity and alignment with REFSQ’s Open Science Initiative. To maintain this connection, future editions of RE-OpenS will always invite the current Open Science co-Chairs of REFSQ to join the organizing committee. This approach fosters collaboration, knowledge transfer, and sustained development of open science practices within the requirements engineering community.</p>
